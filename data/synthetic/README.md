# Synthetic Data Package

**Transparency Score**: 90/100

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This directory contains **synthetically generated** BIM collaboration data 
for research purposes. This data is **NOT** from real construction projects.

## Purpose

To supplement limited publicly available BIM collaboration data and enable 
reproducible research in Graph-RAG systems for digital twins.

## Contents

- `GENERATION_METHODOLOGY.md` - Detailed generation methodology
- `synthetic_validation_report.json` - Statistical validation
- Generation scripts: `../../scripts/generate_*.py`

## Transparency Commitment

We are committed to **full transparency**:

1. ‚úÖ All generation code is open-source
2. ‚úÖ Methodology is fully documented
3. ‚úÖ Limitations are clearly stated
4. ‚úÖ Synthetic data is clearly labeled
5. üîÑ Expert validation in progress

## Limitations

Synthetic data has inherent limitations:

- No actual project context
- Simplified issue complexity
- Template-based patterns
- Limited semantic richness

**We strongly recommend validating findings with real-world data when possible.**

## Ethical Use

If you use this dataset:

1. **Cite properly** - Acknowledge synthetic nature
2. **Be transparent** - Disclose in your paper
3. **Validate** - Cross-check with real data if possible
4. **Contribute** - Help improve methodology
